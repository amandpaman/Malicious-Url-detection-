# Malicious-Url-detection-
My project focuses on malicious URL detection, a crucial aspect of cybersecurity. It involves developing and implementing algorithms and techniques to identify and flag potentially harmful or malicious web addresses. The primary goal is to protect users and systems from cyber threats such as phishing attacks, malware downloads, and fraud.

By analyzing various attributes of URLs, including their structure, domain reputation, and content, the project aims to differentiate between safe and malicious URLs. The project leverages machine learning and data analysis to create predictive models that can classify URLs accurately.

The outcome of this project will contribute to enhancing internet security by providing an automated system capable of identifying and blocking harmful URLs in real-time. This has wide-ranging applications in web browsers, email filters, and network security systems, ultimately safeguarding users from cyberattacks and ensuring a more secure online experience.
